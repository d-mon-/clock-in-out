# clock in & out

node v20.15.1

author: Guerin Olivier

Small personal project with the aim to release it to production

# Setup

I tend to work with a vscode workspace, if you are also interested, you can open the `clockus.code-workspace` provided in this repository in vs code.

- Install `pnpm` https://pnpm.io/fr/installation
- Run `pnpm -r install`
- Run `pnpm dev:backend` & `pnpm dev:frontend` to launch the app
