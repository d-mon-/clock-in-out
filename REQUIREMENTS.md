Description:

ClockUs is an idea I had while working at meetsmore. My managers often complained about the
app not always responding to their needs.
I also got a bad expenrience personally too, where information were often hard to find on the Japanese Apps.
Or the process not being clear enough... Japanese usually love to display a lot of information on their website
but for these apps, it was the opposite...

    - Start-time, End-time, considered as working time or not
  - time correction (notify manager for approval if necessary)
  - PTO, leaves, etc...
    - PTO flow, PTO policy, filtering pto calendar (group/division, date, etc...), etc...
